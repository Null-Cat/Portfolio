                        The game play simulates a branded theme of Flappy Bird with a Kraken Rum twist. The player has
                        to
                        navigate through a series of obstacles aka the krakens tentacles ramping up in difficulty as you
                        progress through the game capped at a certain speed to give players the ability to get a higher
                        score based on skill rather than random number generation. The game also has a series of bonus
                        items that the player can collect
                        to increase their score by risking their lives to get them.

                    <p>
                        As the game was hosted on a public facing website and that there is a high value reward for
                        getting the top scores in this game, I had to ensure that the scores were not manipulated in any
                        way during the competition however due to the nature of public facing websites all scripts are
                        publicly available so I had to use multiple methodologies to slow any perpetrators down before
                        the competition ends.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I did this by using a combination of obfuscation and encryption techniques to ensure that the
                        scores were
                        secure at the time of the competition. One of the techniques that was implemented was done by
                        storing the scores in multiple variables
                        obfuscating the names and functions that check the scores as you pass through each tunnel. I
                        also used a obfuscating tool called "Javascript Obfuscator" to obfuscate the code further by
                        including the whole game script. I also used a encryption technique using AES-128-CBC to encrypt
                        the
                        payload set by
                        Kraken Rum's hosts of the game, this was done by using a encryption key and salt that was
                        provided
                        by the hosts and encrypting the scores then sending the encrypted scores to the API endpoint
                        provided, in
                        the form of a POST request as stated by the API documentation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As I had no access to the API endpoint all cheat detection was done on the client side, this was
                        done
                        by checking if the add score function was triggered as long as the player is in the collision
                        box and triggered once per collision. If the function was triggered more than once per collision
                        then the player was flagged as a cheater and the score was not sent to the API.
                        Another cheat detection was done by comparing the score value to the string value of the UI
                        score
                        and if they did not match then the player was flagged as a cheater and the score was not sent to
                        the API.
